Great book with many useful lessons. The book was writen when Henry Ford was alive and he was the most powerful man on earth.
The principles presented on the book are time-proof, you can totally apply all the principles in this 2018 time.

Lessons that I loved:

## Have a definitive chief aim

Define what you want to do with your life. Invest time thinking about it and write it down

## Have a master mind group
Find people with a mind at your level or higher than yours, and work together to help each other.
_I have a phantom group as well, I met with Jesus, Abraham Lincoln, my brother Nino, master Paulo Caroli in my mind_

## Organised thought
Organise your thoughts. Thoughts come as lose puzzle pieces, it requires time and effort to organise it into a comprehensive narrative.
I like to use Mind Maps to organise my mind. If I have to present it to someone a drawing or slide decks are good tools to communicate.
The ability to write down an essay or a blog post normally is the last state in my organising thoughts process.

## Make a good first impression (care about your clothes!)
You have only one chance to make a good first impression. And as you like it or not,
your clothes matter. So it is important to chose your clothes carefully. In my case I asked help from my wife with this subject. I realised that I'm not naturally good at it, while she is passionate about it. Lucky me :)

## Initiative and leadership
*Initiative* = Do the right thing without anyone telling you to do it.
It is important to learn to do that. You will make some mistakes from time to time but the balance will be positive. At least it will be higher than if you decided to do nothing.
*Leadership* = Doing what is right and good for others. Be a servant leader.

## Action and Enthusiasm
You can have many great ideas. If you don't put then to action you will have nothing.
Doesn't matter what you are doing, do it with enthusiasm. Be mindfull of your moment and enjoy it.

## Self Control
The first person you have to learn to control is yourself. Develop self-control.

## Walk a extra mile (_Do more than what you are paid for_)
This is a secret sauce to success. Do more than what you are paid for. Put an extra hour everyday. Put more effort. Thing about extra things you can do. The law of harvest will be applied.

## Concentration
Keep focus. Use the Pomodoro Technique (_The book doesn't mention it_)

## Cooperation
Two things here:
  * Find people that can co-operate with you
  * Find people who can co-elaborate with you
It requires a team to do awesomeness

## Habit of saving
Key item. Learn to survive with less than what you earn.
Apply the 50/30/20 budget:
  * 50%: Cost of living
  * 30%: Future
  * 20%: Enjoying life
