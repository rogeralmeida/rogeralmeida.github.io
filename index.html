  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Seven components of my seek for work in Aussieland.</h3>

<p>In the last months I have answered the same recurring question:</p>

<p><strong>How did you find a job in Sydney?</strong></p>

<p>This post is a attempt to have a guide to point to describing some components of my journey to Sydney.</p>

<h2>English</h2>

<p><img src="/images/learn_english.jpg" title="Learn English" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>To live abroad you have to at least speak English. So, if you can read this post it is a huge step. I studied English for 18 months and worked with it so I could develop it. Maybe I will create another post share how I learned English.</p>

<p><strong>Component 1: Learn English</strong></p>

<h2>Push yourself to the excellence</h2>

<p>One thing that I didn&rsquo;t realize before starting this process was: I&rsquo;ll compete with the bests of the world. If you are a good professional and can easilly find a job at your current town. Good for you. That doesn&rsquo;t mean all the companies around the world will want you. Even if you are at Google. The concept of good/excellent professional changes from company to company. So keep pushing yourself to excellence. Be prepare to compete with the bests.</p>

<p><strong>Component 2: Push yourself to the excellence</strong></p>

<h2>Where to go?</h2>

<p>I made a list of countries that I would like to live in: Canada, Australia, USA, Germany and Ireland. After some reflection, talks to my wife, and research time I put them in priority order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>Germany</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>USA</li>
</ol>


<p>I believe this is a MUST to everybody who wants to live abroad. You should know what you are looking for. If you don&rsquo;t have this PRIORITIZED list yet, do it now.</p>

<p><strong>Component 3: Create a prioritized list of destinations.</strong></p>

<h2>Update your Linkedin</h2>

<p>I used Linkedin to find a job here at Sydney. Linkedin works, believe me. But there&rsquo;s no free lunch. You have to spend time on your profile. In the late years I started give and ask for recommendations in my network. I also spend time describing my work in each position that I had. I have seen some people who want to find a job abroad but their Linkedin  has no description of the work they did. Would you contract someone who cannot tell you what he did in the past. I don&rsquo;t produce a cv in Microsoft Word for years. I just keep my Linkedin up-to-date and export it to PDF if needed.</p>

<p><strong>Component 4: Give love to your Linkedin</strong></p>

<h2>Search for positions</h2>

<p>Every night, after my kids and wife went to bed I spend between 1 and 2 hours searching for available positions. I followed the prioritized countries&rsquo;s list and used keywords like: Java, Ruby, Developer, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>My method was:
* I should cover page 1 and 2 of search result
* I would only apply for companies that accepted either my Linkedin profile or a PDF. I could not waste time filling forms.
* I wrote a presentation letter to every single position that I liked. This take some time but is essential.
I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I applied more than once for the same position. But I don&rsquo;t believe this is a big issue.</p>

<p>In two weeks doing it I had more interviews than I could handle. So after 2 weeks I stopped the search part and decided to see how the interviews would go.</p>

<p>The most important thing here is: Don&rsquo;t just seat in front of Linkedin and randomly search for things. Develop a method, something that you can improve. For instance, during my first night of search I was filling forms. In the second night I skipped this companies and it improved my capacity of search. Follow a process and improve it.</p>

<p><strong>Component 5: Create a method to search for available positions. Follow it and improve it.</strong></p>

<h2>Interviews</h2>

<p>I had to accommodate the interviews in my day. As I was able to work from home, I could organize to be at home for most of the interviews. But I remember that one day I had to do a interview during lunch time when I was at client site. The good part was that most of the interview were outside working hours.</p>

<p>I failed in most of the interviews. I failed for Amazon in Ireland. No company in Canada wanted to offer me sponsor (I believe they expected me to get the visa by myself). For USA the problem is the Visa, you have to apply in a specific time-frame. Pivotal, for instance, liked my resume but we would have to wait till February to apply for a visa. But Germany and Australia were promising.</p>

<p>I went to the final round with eBay in Berlim and DiUS in Sydney.</p>

<p>People at eBay liked me, but they decided to pick another person with more mobile experience.</p>

<p>The process with DiUS was working fine, slow, but fine. I was on vacation during the last interviews. I did the big mistake of going to a isolated island in Sao Paulo/Brazil. The internet was not that good and the only lan-house closed at 09:00 pm. But in the end it worked out. On 23/12/2014 I received the job offer.</p>

<p><strong>Component 6: Organize your time and resource (e.g. internet)  for the interviews.</strong></p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>

<p><strong>This is the most important component: Repeat steps 1 through 7.</strong></p>

<p>One point that I would like to highlight is: I was prepared to start the search for positions again. It was not a single time thing. I decided to live abroad and I was willing to iterate the search step until I find a position suitable to me. So if you fail as I fail in most of the interviews, be prepared to try again. Reflect about what is working well and what you would like to improve and do it. Don&rsquo;t give up easily.</p>

<p>I hope this can help someone someday.</p>

<p>After receiving the offer another journey begins. The Visa! But this is a topic to future posts. Peace!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was working for <a href="http://www.atos.net">Atos</a>, the company&rsquo;s CEO started a <a href="http://atos.net/en-us/home/we-are/zero-email.html">zero email initiative</a>. His aim was for the employees not to use email for internal communications. I remembered what I thought about it: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible&rdquo;.
Now I believe that he was right.
This post explains how I deal with my professional email inbox.</p>

<h2>Keep email closed</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t keep my email inbox open during the working hours. I open it just when I have to. I also disabled the email notification in my cellphone. That prevents me from check email whatever I see that a new email arrived.</p>

<h2>Schedule time to check email</h2>

<p>I check my email twice a day, at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm. I have reminders in my calendar . That helps me organize my day and prevents me from being fooled by my weak memory.</p>

<h2>Time box email time</h2>

<p>As an adopter of the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> I keep track of the time I spend with email. What I noticed is that I need almost two pomodoros  to read/respond/forward/archive my emails. That means that I need almost two hours during my day only to deal with my email inbox.  That was so true when I was working for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. Now that I&rsquo;m working for <a href="http://dius.com.au/">DiUS</a> I&rsquo;m trying not to sign in to so many email lists. My aim is to keep my email time in one pomodoro.</p>

<h2>So far, so good</h2>

<p>Up until here I&rsquo;ve described what I have been doing for one year. It&rsquo;s working fine and I&rsquo;ve noticed that my productive increased since then. Before I was checking email every time I alternated windows. Now, I can alternate windows without the temptation of checking email. But there is one last step that  I wanna try&hellip;</p>

<h2>Vacation Responder On</h2>

<p>From today on I&rsquo;ll keep my Vacation Responder On in my professional email. This is the message that I will send to those who send me email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>

<p>This is a auto-reply to inform you about my email policy:</p>

<ul>
<li>I keep my email inbox closed during the working hours;</li>
<li>I also disabled email notifications in my cellphone;</li>
<li>I check email only at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you need to contact me before my email times, feel free to reach me by phone: XXXX XXX XXX. If you prefer you can use Whatsapp or Viber with this number as well.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wanted to try it for a long time, but never had courage to actually turn it on. I&rsquo;ll use it for some time, and depending on the feedback I will keep it or not. Who knows, maybe it can became a new post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I decided to start a project where I gonna implement the same problem in many languages. I always wanted to compare how different programming languages face some coding challenges. I don&rsquo;t want to prove that any language is better than other, althought I know that this kind of flame will happen.
To have a organized list of problems I gonna use the <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems.</p>
