      Although I have the honour to be presenting here, I will be talking about not the work a person, a team or a department. The stories I will be sharing here today is the result of the effort of many brillant people who had passion and patience to take Tyro through the Journey it went through.

    %h1 Pair Programming
  %section
    %h2 Definition
    .blockquote
      Two team members working on the same task, at the same time, using the same computer.
  %section
    %h2 History
    %ul
      %li Alternative to the common review process
      %li Jira and Git
      %li Auditors
    %aside.notes
      :markdown
        * We started to adopt Pair Programming during the early days of the company. It was working well and when we spoke to APRA we explain to then how that was actually better then code review, as it would enforce two minds to work on the same problem. 
        * With pair rotation, we have more code review than a normal code review at the end. 
        * Pair programming facilitates the creation of small batches which enhances the delivery by reducing our cycle time and our working in progress.
        * But for the auditors we needed to prove that we were able to follow the process we had defined. That is were Jira and Git played a great role. We have created a way to record who introduced the change from the code and why that change was introduced.

    %ul
      %li Code Review
    %aside.notes
      :markdown
        * Pair programming was a strategy that enabled us to avoid a slow code review process early on. Pair programming still part of our DNA. Although we have much more flexibility about pairing or not, it still happening daily in our office.
