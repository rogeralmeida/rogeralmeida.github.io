When I was working for [Atos](http://www.atos.net), the company's CEO started a [zero e-mail initiative](http://atos.net/en-us/home/we-are/zero-email.html). His aim was that the employees do not use e-mail for internal communications. By the time I remember that I thought: "It's impossible".
Now I believe that  he was right.
This post explains how I deal with my professional e-mail box.

## Keep e-mail closed
I don't keep my e-mail box open during the working hours. I open it just when I have to. I also disabled the e-mail notification in my cellphone. That prevents me to check e-mail whatever I see that a new e-mail arrived.

##Schedule time to check e-mail
I check my e-mail twice a day, at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm. I have reminders in my calendar . That helps me organize my day and prevents me to be fooled by my weak memory.

##Time box e-mail time
As a adopter of the [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) I keep track of the time I spend with email. What I noticed is that I need almost two pomodoros  to read/respond/forward/archive my e-mails. That means that I need almost two hours during my day only to deal with my e-mail box.  That was so true when I was working for [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/). Now that I'm working for [DiUS](http://dius.com.au/) I'm trying to do not sign in to so much e-mail's lists. I aim to keep my e-mail time in one pomodoro.

##So far, so good
Till here I described what I have being doing for one year. It's working fine and I notice that my productive increased since then. Before I was checking e-mail every time I alternated windows. Now, I can alternate windows without the temptation of checking e-mail. But there is one last step that  I wanna try...

##Vacation Responder On
From today on I'll keep my Vacation Responder On in my professional e-mail. This is the message that I will send to who send me e-mail:

>Hi,

>This a auto-reply to inform you about my e-mail policy. I keep my e-mail box closed during the working hours.  I also disabled e-mail notifications in my cellphone. I check e-mail only at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm.  If you need to contact me before my e-mail times, feel free to reach me by phone: XXXX XXX XXX. If you prefer you can use Whatsapp or Viber with this number as well.

I wanted to try it for a long time, but never had the balls to actually turn it on. I'll use it for some time, and depending on the feedback I will keep it or not. Who knows, maybe it can became a new post.

##Credits
This is not my idea, I read about it in Vida Organizada (pt-br only).
