According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse):

<p class="blockquote">
 <strong>Reuse</strong> is the action or practice of using something again, whether for its original purpose (conventional reuse) or to fulfil a different function (creative reuse or repurposing).
</p>

When we are developing a new feature it is quite common that we implement some parts of the code in way that it can be reusable.
It is a trap, don't do it.
To reuse something, you first have to use.
Use your code in production, than evolve it to be reusable if you have to.
