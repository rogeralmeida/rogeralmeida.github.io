# Tracing Bullet

When starting a software project there are many uncertainties that need to be adressed:

* Business Conditions
* Technical Risks
* Performance

One critical component of a software archtecture are the integration points between the many components. While your software is moving data in-memory it is operating in a controlled environment. But when you have to move this data between diferrent components that you have a high chance of having problems.
The tracing bullet is a delivery pattern that adresses this risk early on in a software delivery project.
The idea comes from a bad source, from wikipedia:
> a ammunition built with a small pyrotechnic charge in their base. Ignited by the burning powder, the pyrotechnic composition burns very brightly, making the projectile trajectory visible to the naked eye during daylight, and very bright during nighttime firing. This enables the shooter to make aiming corrections without observing the impact of the rounds fired and without using the sights of the weapon. Tracer fire can also be used to signal to other shooters where to concentrate their fire during battle.
The software delivery application is: "How we can send a bullet through out our new software so that we can inspect it and correct course if nedded.
