    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was working for <a href="http://www.atos.net">Atos</a>, the company&rsquo;s CEO started a <a href="http://atos.net/en-us/home/we-are/zero-email.html">zero email initiative</a>. His aim was for the employees not to use email for internal communications. I remembered what I thought about it: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible&rdquo;.
Now I believe he was right.
This post explains how I deal with my professional email inbox.</p>

<h2>Keep email closed</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t keep my email inbox open during the working hours. I open it just when I have to. I also disabled the email notification in my cellphone. That prevents me from check email whatever I see that a new email arrived.</p>

<h2>Schedule time to check email</h2>

<p>I check my email twice a day, at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm. I have reminders in my calendar . That helps me organize my day and prevents me from being fooled by my weak memory.</p>

<h2>Time box email time</h2>

<p>As an adopter of the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> I keep track of the time I spend with email. What I noticed is that I need almost two pomodoros  to read/respond/forward/archive my emails. That means that I need almost two hours during my day only to deal with my email inbox.  That was so true when I was working for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. Now that I&rsquo;m working for <a href="http://dius.com.au/">DiUS</a> I&rsquo;m trying not to sign in to so many email lists. My aim is to keep my email time in one pomodoro.</p>

<h2>So far, so good</h2>

<p>Up until here I&rsquo;ve described what I have been doing for one year. It&rsquo;s working fine and I&rsquo;ve noticed that my productive increased since then. Before I was checking email every time I alternated windows. Now, I can alternate windows without the temptation of checking email. But there is one last step that  I wanna try&hellip;</p>

<h2>Vacation Responder On</h2>

<p>From today on I&rsquo;ll keep my Vacation Responder On in my professional email. This is the message that I will send to those who send me email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>

<p>This is an auto-reply to inform you about my email policy:</p>

<ul>
<li>I keep my email inbox closed during the working hours;</li>
<li>I also disabled email notifications in my cellphone;</li>
<li>I check email only at 10:00 am and 04:00 pm.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you need to contact me before my email times, feel free to reach me by phone: XXXX XXX XXX. If you prefer you can use Whatsapp or Viber with this number as well.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wanted to try it for a long time, but never had courage to actually turn it on. I&rsquo;ll use it for some time, and depending on the feedback I will keep it or not. Who knows, maybe it can became a new post.</p>
